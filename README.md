# Crimsoned
An infinite runner made in Unity3D.  
Terrain is made from blocks.  
Every block you contact turns crimson.  
A crimsoned block has a 1/2 chance to dissapear.  
The rows are randomized and reused making the game progressivly more difficult.  
Use arrow keys to strafe.
There is also terrain on the cieling.
Use spacebar to invert gravity.
Your score is (seconds survived * cubes crimsoned)

##### TODO:
